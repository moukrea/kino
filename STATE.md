### Session 001 — Foundation bootstrap

**Branch:** `claude/session-001-bootstrap-rsgXK`
(The harness-supplied branch overrides the AGENT_PROMPT `agent/session-NNN-*`
naming convention. Future sessions follow whichever branch the harness assigns
or, if none assigned, the protocol's `agent/session-NNN-<slug>` form.)

**Scope chosen:** F-001 partial — workspace metadata, Rust crate skeletons,
locked-content modules, Android keystore, initial CI, and STATE.md bootstrap.
Full Tauri host (`src-tauri/`) and SolidJS frontend (`frontend/`) are
deliberately deferred to Session 002 because the Tauri 2 CLI is not installed
in this environment and pulling it in (plus the Android NDK and SolidJS
tooling) would balloon Session 001 into a multi-hour install marathon with no
verifiable output. The protocol explicitly invites this "scaffolding +
implementation" split.

**Files added (summary):**

- Repo metadata: `LICENSE` (MIT, "kino contributors", 2026), `README.md`,
  `.gitignore`, `rust-toolchain.toml` (pinned to 1.94.1, the stable Rust
  shipped with this environment).
- Workspace root: `Cargo.toml` declaring the five crates from PRD §3 (with
  shared `[workspace.dependencies]` and `[workspace.package]` metadata).
  `src-tauri/` is intentionally NOT yet in the members list — see ADR-031.
- `crates/kino-core/`: shell + `constants` (every numeric constant from
  PRD §8) + `title` (TitleKind / TitleSummary) + `stream` (Quality / Hdr /
  Codec / Audio / ParsedTags enums) + `Error` / `Result`. `forbid(unsafe_code)`.
- `crates/kino-torrent/`: shell + `trackers` (full PRD §8 supplementary list).
- `crates/kino-server/`: shell only (axum wiring lands with F-013).
- `crates/kino-addons/`: shell + `parse` (full PRD §8 regex set + behavioral
  tests covering all four locked fixtures) + `recommended` (full PRD §8
  addon table with Cinemeta pinned as `CINEMETA_MANIFEST_URL` for F-007 to
  reference).
- `crates/kino-metadata/`: shell only (provider clients land with F-003).
- `migrations/0001_init.sql`: locked schema from PRD §F-002.
- `android/keystore/kino-dev.keystore`: generated with `keytool` per PRD §F-001
  exact parameters (PKCS12, RSA 2048, alias `kino-dev`, store/key pw `kinodev`,
  validity 10000 d, `CN=kino dev, O=kino, C=FR`). Committed by design.
- `android/keystore/README.md`: documents the keystore is committed for
  sideload reproducibility and is not a security control.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: rust job (fmt / clippy / test) wired to
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` + cargo cache. `build-linux` /
  `build-android` jobs deliberately omitted until the Tauri host exists, so
  the green badge actually means something.

**Features advanced:**

- F-001: not started → in progress
  - Done: workspace layout, all metadata files, all 5 crate skeletons, locked
    constants/trackers/recommended/parse, keystore, keystore docs, CI scaffolding.
  - Remaining for completion: `src-tauri/` Tauri 2 binary, `frontend/` SolidJS
    app, `cargo tauri build` (Linux) verified green, `cargo tauri android build`
    verified green. These are Session 002's primary scope.

**ADRs filed this session:**

- **ADR-029** (parse regex precision): PRD §8 specifies trailing `\b` on the
  audio detectors `\b(EAC3|DDP|DD\+|E-AC-3)\b` and `\b(AC3|DD)\b`, but the
  PRD's own locked fixture row 3 (`Some Show S01E01 720p WEB-DL DDP5.1 H.264`)
  requires `DDP5.1` to be tagged as EAC3. `\bDDP\b` cannot match `DDP5.1`
  because `P→5` is not a word boundary. The fixture table is the behavioral
  spec, so the implementation in `crates/kino-addons/src/parse.rs` tightens
  the trailing boundary to `(?:\b|\d)` — a real word boundary OR a single
  digit (e.g. a channel-count prefix like `5.1`/`7.1`). Regression test
  `audio_does_not_false_positive_on_letter_suffixes` proves the fix doesn't
  open the door to `DDS` / `DDPL` style false positives. See PRD Issues for
  the corresponding §8 revision request.
- **ADR-030** (workspace lints): each crate sets `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
  via `[lints.rust]` and enables `clippy::all + pedantic` with three narrowly
  scoped `allow`s (`module_name_repetitions`, `must_use_candidate`,
  `missing_errors_doc`). The first is noise for a multi-crate workspace, the
  other two are pre-empted because they would force premature documentation
  churn on shells. CI runs `-D warnings`, so the lint level is enforced.
- **ADR-031** (`src-tauri/` not in workspace until it compiles): listing
  `src-tauri/` in `[workspace] members` before the directory has a
  `Cargo.toml` would break `cargo build --workspace` from day one. Session 002
  adds the directory and amends `Cargo.toml`.
- **ADR-032** (cross-constant invariants as compile-time asserts): the
  relationships between locked constants (e.g. `PREBUFFER_TARGET_S <
  SAFETY_MARGIN_S`) are enforced by `const _: () = assert!(...)` at module
  level in `kino-core/src/constants.rs`. Any value bump that breaks the PRD
  math fails the build, not just `cargo test`. Strictly stronger than the
  runtime tests they replace.

**Tests added / coverage notes:**

- 23 unit tests across the workspace, all green: constants (2), title (2),
  trackers (3), parse (12 — including the 4 PRD-locked fixture cases + the
  ADR-029 regression guard), recommended (4).
- Three constant invariants enforced at compile time (ADR-032).

**Known issues introduced or resolved:**

- None introduced. PRD Issue filed for §8 regex set — see below.

**Heads-up for Session 002:**

- The natural scope is "F-001 completion": create `src-tauri/` (Tauri 2
  binary, `tauri.conf.json` set to App ID `dev.kino.app` and display name
  `kino`, placeholder home that renders the text `kino`), create `frontend/`
  (Vite + SolidJS + Tailwind + i18n with `en.json` + `fr.json` placeholders),
  add `src-tauri` to the workspace members list (resolving ADR-031), and
  extend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a `build-linux` job that runs
  `cargo tauri build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. If that's too big in
  practice, split: 002 = src-tauri scaffold, 003 = frontend scaffold + CI
  build job. Either way F-001 moves to `[x]` by the end.
- `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0"` is required in the session
  container. Budget ~5 min of compile time.
- The Android build job (`cargo tauri android build`) needs the Android NDK
  + SDK; if not installed in the session container, install with
  `sdkmanager --install "ndk;26.1.10909125"` (the LTS NDK at the time of
  writing). May need to defer to Session 003 if the container is slow.

## Architectural Decisions Log

ADR-001 through ADR-028 are inherited from `PRD.md` §7. They are immutable.

Additional ADRs filed by sessions:

| ID | Decision | Session |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-029 | Tighten audio EAC3/AC3 trailing boundary to `(?:\b\|\d)` to satisfy PRD §8 fixture `DDP5.1 → EAC3`. PRD §8 regex text is treated as a strong recommendation; the locked fixture table is the binary acceptance spec. | 001 |
| ADR-030 | Per-crate `forbid(unsafe_code)` + `clippy::pedantic` with `module_name_repetitions / must_use_candidate / missing_errors_doc` allowed. CI enforces `-D warnings`. | 001 |
| ADR-031 | `src-tauri/` is omitted from `[workspace].members` until its `Cargo.toml` exists (lands Session 002). | 001 |
| ADR-032 | Cross-constant relational invariants (e.g. `PREBUFFER_TARGET_S < SAFETY_MARGIN_S`) are compile-time `const _: () = assert!(..)` rather than runtime tests. | 001 |

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

_None yet._

## PRD Issues

- **§8 regex set, audio EAC3/AC3 trailing boundary contradicts fixture
  table.** The locked regexes `\b(EAC3|DDP|DD\+|E-AC-3)\b` and
  `\b(AC3|DD)\b` cannot match the locked fixture filename
  `Some Show S01E01 720p WEB-DL DDP5.1 H.264` (intended to yield EAC3),
  because there is no word boundary between `P` and `5` in `DDP5.1`. The
  fix shipped in Session 001 (ADR-029) replaces the trailing `\b` with
  `(?:\b|\d)` — a real word boundary OR a single digit — which preserves
  the rejection of letter-suffixed false positives like `DDS` while
  accepting channel-count suffixes that are standard in scene release
  names. **Suggested PRD §8 revision:** update the documented regex
  strings to match the shipped implementation, e.g.
  `\b(?:EAC3|DDP|DD\+|E-AC-3)(?:\b|\d)` and `\b(?:AC3|DD)(?:\b|\d)`. No
  behavioral change is needed; this is a documentation correction.

## §6B Regressions

_Filed by the human when §6B items fail. Sessions address these as highest-priority scope._

## Cross-Session Conventions

Populated as conventions are established:

- **Crate layout.** Each crate under `crates/` follows the structure
  `Cargo.toml` (with `[lints.rust]` and `[lints.clippy]` from ADR-030) +
  `src/lib.rs` (declares modules, exports nothing else top-level unless
  needed) + one file per module. Tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
  inside the module under test.
- **Dependency discipline.** Shared deps live in
  `[workspace.dependencies]` and are pulled into individual crates with
  `{ workspace = true }`. Per-feature deps (e.g. librqbit, axum) are added
  in the session that implements the feature, not preemptively, so unrelated
  sessions don't pay their compile cost.
- **Locked content lives in PRD-pinned modules.** Constants → `kino-core::constants`.
  Trackers → `kino-torrent::trackers`. Filename regex set → `kino-addons::parse`.
  Recommended addons → `kino-addons::recommended`. Migrations → `migrations/`.
- **PRD line numbers are not stable references.** When citing PRD provisions
  in code comments or ADR text, cite the section / feature ID (e.g.
  `PRD §F-014`, `PRD §8`), never line numbers.
